# AI_Mini_Project

##  Create a non-generative AI system that will recommend movies or TV shows
for users to watch based on their preferences and platform subscriptions (Netflix, Hulu,
etc.). Integrate this model into a chat bot that can have a conversation to best recommend
what to watch!

## Getting started

### Configure Kaggle
Before running the code, make sure you've set up the Kaggle API credentials. To do this, follow these steps:

    1. Go to your Kaggle account settings page.
    2. Scroll down to the API section and click on "Create New API Token". This will download a kaggle.json file with your API credentials.
    3. Place this file in the ~/.kaggle/ directory (for Windows, C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\).

### Install python package requirements
    pip install -r requirements.txt
