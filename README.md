# AI_Mini_Project



## Getting started

Before running the code, make sure you've set up the Kaggle API credentials. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Kaggle account settings page.
2. Scroll down to the API section and click on "Create New API Token". This will download a kaggle.json file with your API credentials.
3. Place this file in the ~/.kaggle/ directory (for Windows, C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\).
